# Realm of Xados

## Description
Welcome to Realm of Xados, an infinite runner game I'm currently working on.

This project was inspired by my love of escape scenarios in games like Ori, Uncharted etc.

The game currently has a procedurally generated infinte level system and a movement style involving lots of swinging (guess where I got that from)

This video really kickstarted the project, the movement really helped me visualise what I wanted to make
- Every procedural resource I could read from procgen space
